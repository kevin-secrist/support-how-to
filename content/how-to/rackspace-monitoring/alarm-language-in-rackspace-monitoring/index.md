Rackspace Monitoring provides a powerful [alarm language](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#alarm-language) that enables you to set thresholds and create complex alarms. Using Rackspace Monitoring rather than a Nagios server, for example, provides the following benefits:

- Create expressive alarms that validate multiple criteria, using a JavaScript-like language rather than a JSON API. Following is an example alarm definition:

       if (metric['duration'] > 2000) {
         return CRITICAL, "HTTP request took more than 2 seconds, it took #{duration} milliseconds."
       }
       if (metric['duration'] > 1000) {
         return WARNING, "HTTP request took more than 1 second, it took #{duration} milliseconds."
       }
       # Check for an empty body match
       if (metric['body_match'] == "") {
         return CRITICAL, "Body match missing"
       }
       return OK, "HTTP connection time is normal"

- Use solution patterns to help you create your own complex alarms. Use our API to keep up-to-date on these examples.

- Put developers in control by letting them build thresholds similar to how you create your application code.

- Test thresholds before you configure them. Use data from the [test check API operation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#testing-the-check) and feed that into the [test alarm operation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#test-an-alarm) to simulate an alerting scenario.

- Use multiple data center alert policies to seamlessly evaluate alarm criteria from multiple data centers. The following graph shows a check running in three monitoring zones. The yellow and red areas represent when an alarm is in WARNING and CRITICAL, respectively.

- Send an alert to [different notification addresses depending on severity](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-monitoring/v1/developer-guide/#document-api-operations/notification-plans-operations).

- Reduce false alerts on network issues.

- Start monitoring faster and spend less system admin time on ensuring that the server stays online.
